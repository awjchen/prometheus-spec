# prometheus-spec

A [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) client library where you use a GADT to
explictly specify your metrics.

This library provides no automation of instrumentation. Instrumentation is
completely manual and controlled. If this sounds tedious to you, you may be
more interested in metrics libraries in the style of
[autometrics](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-rs).

Forked from [ekg-core](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ekg-core).
